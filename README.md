# Real-time-object-detection
In this repositery i have developed real-time-object-detection using tensorflow. I have run this project on Ubuntu, but i believe this will also run successfully on windows with minor changes. Also i used CPU, if you are using GPU then i believe you have installed TensorFlow-GPU, and set-up Object Detection directory structure and Anaconda Virtual Environment (setting up Anoconda environment is optional). The folowing .gif file shows output of program trained with 6 classes (computer monitor, keyboard, printer, water bottle, mouse, telephone and calculator).

In this tutorial, i assume that you have successfully installed Object Detection API. You can test it out and verify your installation is working by launching the object_detection_tutorial.ipynb script with Jupyter. In this tutorial we used Faster-RCNN-Inception-V2-COCO model from TensorFlow's model zoo. Download and open faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28.tar.gz file with a file archiver such as WinZip or 7-Zip and extract the faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28 folder to the object_detection under C:\...\models\research\object_detection.
